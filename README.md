# 🌸 Femwise – AI-Powered Period & Health Tracker  

Femwise is an AI-powered menstrual and female health tracking app designed to make health insights **simple, reliable, and accessible**.  
It predicts upcoming periods, provides cycle insights, and gives suggestions on when to consult a doctor – all powered by AI and connected with a real-time database.

## ✨ Problem It Solves  

Many women struggle with:  
- **Uncertainty about cycles** – not knowing exactly when the next period will come.  
- **Limited health insights** – most trackers just mark dates without telling what’s happening inside the body.  
- **Fragmented experience** – switching between apps for tracking, reminders, and health tips.  

**Femwise solves this** by combining **AI insights + simple tracking** in one place. It doesn’t just remind you of dates – it helps you understand your body better and makes health management safer and easier.

## 🔑 Key Features  

- 📅 **AI Period Prediction** – predicts next period dates with higher accuracy.  
- 💡 **Body Condition Insights** – tells what’s happening in different phases of the cycle (fertile, luteal, period, etc.).  
- 🏥 **Health Guidance** – alerts if irregularities occur and suggests when to consult a doctor.  
- ☁️ **Firestore Database** – secure, real-time storage for user data and logs.  
- 🎨 **Clean UI** – simple onboarding and modern interface designed for usability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** Flutter, dart language and kotlin (mockup/prototype for now)  
- **Backend & Database:** Firebase Firestore  
- **AI Integration:** AI Gemini APIs for health insights & predictions  
- **Track Selected:** 🚀 Windsurf – AI-powered IDE to speed up building and debugging

## 🧩 Challenges I Ran Into  

There were many, but the hardest part was connecting Firestore and handling logic around it:  
- The onboarding flow often got stuck because Firestore didn’t give access properly.  
- Sometimes it didn’t even show what was wrong, which made debugging painful.  
- As a medical student, I found the logic simple once I reviewed it carefully – but setting up the database and rules was a real nightmare at first.  

Eventually, I fixed it by reviewing permissions, restructuring the onboarding flow, and leaning on Windsurf AI assistance to debug quickly.

## 🚀 Why Windsurf

As a medical student, I don’t have a deep programming background. I rely heavily on AI tools to build faster and avoid getting lost in bugs. Windsurf gave me the perfect **AI coding partner** – it let me focus on solving the actual problem instead of spending hours fixing syntax or configuration issues.  

This way, I could put my energy into the **medical + problem-solving side** while still shipping a working AI prototype.

## 📌 Future Scope  

- 📊 **Deeper AI analysis** of patterns (irregular cycles, lifestyle factors).  
- 🌐 **Multi-language support** for accessibility.  
- 🔔 **Smart reminders** for medication, ovulation, and doctor visits.  
- 🤝 **Community features** – safe space for women to share and learn.

## 🏆 What I Learned  

- How to integrate AI into real-world health applications.  
- Setting up and debugging Firestore database connections.  
- Balancing between being a **medical student** and a **builder** – using AI to bridge the gap.  
- Importance of building **usable, practical tools** over just mockups.
